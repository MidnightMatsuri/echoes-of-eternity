	- 2-3 Hours

	- Give heads up, if its one person cant make it but 5 are available\
	- We can do side quest sessions?
	- Reschedule Time
	- Player Cant opt to skip session (3+ Skips will result in leaving the campaign)
- **Food, Snacks, Drinks**
	- Eat away homie, snacks are non negotiable
- **Rules debating**
	- As we're all new to this, we may take brief pauses to check in certain rules, if something a player wants to do seems super reasonable and a dice roll would be sufficient, we can improvise the most fair results looking outside of the official rulebooks.


## Out of Game Expectations

- **Alcohol**
	- Drinks are fine, just don't be drunk. Consequences would be you ain't playing 
- **Narcotics**
	- Same as above
- **Cellphones**
	- Allowed, just pay attention. Its drone phase not phone phase
- **Player Attention**
	- If a player is constantly distracted, there'll be a 3 strike rule
		- Strike 1
		- Strike 2
		- Strike 3: We kick you out of the session
- **Disruptive Topics**
	- As we're all learning the game, there'll be off topic discussions that may create tangents, lets try to stay focused about the game, discussions about game mechanics and whatnot are all valid and there won't be any penalty for that
- **Unannounced Dice Rolls**
	- Dice rolls are only made when requested/asked to. Unannounced dice rolls won't count towards gameplay
- **Dice rolls against one another**
	- Dice rolls against another player will only be allowed if Green-lit by the DM and both parties consent.
- **Player vs Player**
	- Debates are fine, tension is fine, arguments are fine, all in character. Attacking other players is not allowed. If an attack against another player is for example a help action in combat, that is allowed (Doubles in Pok√©mon reference) Keep real life tension out of character play
- **Player Character Secrets**
	- All in game secrets are allowed, you can keep secrets from other players, and other NPCs, However, all secrets must be sent to and approved by the DM to keep story/gameplay consistency
- **Player Discomfort**
	- Everyone will be on the same page as to what ethical plots are in the game. If everyone agrees on the ethics but then feels uncomfortable later in the story when such an event actually happens, you may step aside (mute chat) until the interaction is over
- **Player Agency**
	- Everyone has the ability to influence the world and story as their characters within reason. Player Agency and creativity is not only welcome but encouraged.
- **Spotlight Sharing**
	- Be mindful of other characters spotlights/scenes, everyone will be getting experiences catered towards them. You are welcome to provide some helpful context if your character has knowledge on the situation, but allow each player to experience their spotlight moments alone. I don't want to have a situation where someone is upset because someone stole the spotlight from them, but didn't voice their discomfort.
- **Meta-Gaming**
	- Minimal meta-gaming, if you want to ask if your character noticed another character do something, we can determine that when requested but keep it to a minimum. Do not change/make decisions for your character because of knowledge like what the other person rolled. 
- **Min-Maxing**
	- No (Minimal), we're here to have fun and play a roleplaying game, not a strictly dice rolling game. I don't want youtubing build ideas, play the game how your character would navigate the world they are in. 
- **Murder Hobos**
	- This campaign setting is not setup for Murder Hobo-ing. There will be consequences for unreasonably killing people. Killing NPCs within reason is more than okay.
- **Common Sense**
	- Be mindful, communicate, D&D is a social game, I want to ensure everyone is having a good time. Be respectful to one another, if a player makes decisions that you/your character wouldnt make, be mindful of discussing it. 

## Ethics Concerns

- **Attraction and Sexual Orientation**
	- Anything goes, because of how many races there are, even with religion in the mix, you're more than welcome to be attracted to NPCs that differ from your personal views. If you feel uncomfortable with interactions that may play out, communicate it, everyone has their own views.
- **Rape and Sexual Assault**
	- Not allowed, not present, nah
- **Slavery**
	- There may be brief mentions of slavery set in this worlds history, but active slavery will be at a minimum (slavery topics may revolve around revolutions, not the active act of enslaving)
- **Racism**
	- There'll be surface level racism. There won't be outright slurs being thrown around, but there are preconceived prejudices set in this world. 

## Player Experience

- **Pet Peeves**
	- Provide me a short list of your personal pet peeves, things about the game/sessions that may bother you as an actual player (turns taking too long etc.) 
- **Earning XP**
	- XP will be given on a milestone variant, we'll be going off a mix of achievements and a calendar system. Players won't be levelling up after 2 days of in-game adventuring. It's not really realistic to do it that way, but rather a columniation of achievements, time, and a fair balance for everyone.
- **Levelling Up**
	- Levelling Up will happen typically outside of sessions once achievements have been made. The DM and players will individually go over levelling up, so everyone has a chance to showcase their new abilities as surprises/have a cool moment to show off.
- **Campaign Length**
	- Indefinite, however please provide me with some realistic commitment time to the campaign, for example if X wants to play for 4 years but Y wants to play for 6 months. The player character leaving in 6 months would have made some cool achievements and have a noble/fun send off, and the campaign will continue with the remaining party members. The Mainline story can end at a collective discussion but the world itself can go for however long. 
- **Player Death**
	- Players can choose to make new characters, or decide to leave if they don't want to create a new character. DnD is permadeath, once you're dead dead, you're gone. 
- **Resurrections**
	- There may be means of reviving characters should they fall. The likelihood of you finding these means are about 1%

## Post-Session 0

- After session zero, anyone that wants to, we can one on one go over your character so you have all the knowledge about who you are. Think of fun ways to introduce your character to the in-game world/everyone at the table. We can familiarize you with your class and mechanics and such. We could also do this as a group.
