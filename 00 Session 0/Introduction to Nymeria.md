## Introduction to Nymeria for Session Zero

Welcome, adventurers, to the mystical world of Nymeria. This land is a tapestry of diverse biomes, ancient magic, and rich history, where every corner holds a story waiting to be uncovered. From the icy peaks of Frostpire to the volcanic heights of Flameforge, Nymeria is a realm where the natural and supernatural intertwine. The regions of North, East, South, and West Nymeria each offer their unique challenges and wonders, with the Zarath Desert and Flameforge Heights adding even more variety to the landscape.

Nymeria's history is as vast as its lands, with civilizations rising and falling, heroes and villains shaping its destiny. The calendar year is 1825 AC, a time known as the Era of Luminaissance, where modernization and ancient wisdom coexist. The 12 months of the Aelorian calendar, from Luminara to Frostflow, mark the passage of time, while the seven days of the week, starting with Fayday and ending with Vorday, set the rhythm of life. This world is governed by a delicate balance of power, with the High Council in Felshadow overseeing the major regions, while various political factions, trade guilds, and shadowy organizations vie for influence.

As you embark on this journey, you will find yourselves in the heart of Ravenmoor Outpost, a humble yet strategically significant settlement. This outpost is a melting pot of cultures and races, each contributing to its vibrant life. The outpostâ€™s leader, Tessa Windrider, a wise and powerful ravenfolk warlock, has mysteriously gone missing, setting the stage for your adventure. Ravenmoor is surrounded by the enigmatic forests of Mystwood and Briarhill, each with its own secrets and dangers. To the north lie the treacherous Frostpire Peaks, while to the south, the bustling trade routes connect to the great cities to the likes of Tempfel and Brightwater.

Your quest will take you through ancient ruins, bustling cities, untamed wilderness, moments of great political divide, mystical secrets and a vast world to explore. You will encounter powerful political factions like the Silver Hand and the Golden Coin Guild, each with their own agendas. The verdant forests of Moonlit Canopy and the arid expanses of Zarath Desert hold both peril and promise. Trade routes crisscross the land, with merchants and adventurers plying their wares and skills, while underground networks like the Shadow Syndicate and Nightshade Trading Network operate in the shadows.

Prepare to immerse yourselves in a world where every decision you make will echo through the ages. The fate of Nymeria may very well rest in your hands as you uncover its hidden truths, forge alliances, and confront ancient evils. Adventure, intrigue, and magic await you at every turn. Welcome to Nymeria, where legends are born, and destinies are forged.
