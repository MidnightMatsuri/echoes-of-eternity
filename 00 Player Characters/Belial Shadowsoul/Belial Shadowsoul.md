- ## Background and History
	- Intro:
		- Belial was born in the heart of The Flame, a volatile volcanic region that served as a haven for his Tiefling family. The rugged landscape of his homeland, characterized by flowing lava and harsh volcanic soil, was not only their sanctuary but a symbol of their resilience. Belial's early life was shaped by his family’s strong bonds and the protective presence of Maul, their fiendish guardian. Under the guidance of his mother, Ravenna, and alongside his siblings, Lucious and Lirana, Belial learned the values of loyalty and strength. They lived a secluded but fulfilling life, where the fiery environment taught Belial to respect and harness the power of fire, turning their challenging surroundings into a source of warmth and security.
	- Brief History:
		- Tragedy struck when celestial forces, driven by a zealous mission to cleanse the world of Tiefling blood, launched a brutal assault on The Flame. Belial’s family, a beacon of unity amidst the chaos, became a prime target. He witnessed the massacre of his kin by celestial warriors, a horrific event that seared itself into his memory. His mother and siblings perished in a blaze of celestial flames, and Maul, their father, fell defending them. In the inferno’s aftermath, Belial was left alone, spared by the attackers for reasons unknown, perhaps as a cruel twist of fate or as a deliberate act to let him suffer. This traumatic experience ignited a burning hatred for celestial beings and a deep-rooted anger towards the fire that once comforted him but now served as a reminder of his loss.
	- Notable Achievements / Conclusion:
		- Desperate to avenge his family and fueled by his searing hatred, Belial sought power through a dark pact with Azazel, the Forsaken Angel. This fallen celestial, exiled from the heavens, saw in Belial a potential ally in his own quest against celestial tyranny. Azazel offered Belial the strength and dark knowledge he craved, in exchange for his loyalty and service. Embracing his new path, Belial immersed himself in the dark arts, his once reserved demeanor hardening into ruthless determination. He adopted Sidious, a young orphan he found wandering in the ruins of their home, and trained him rigorously in combat and magic, ensuring he would never be as vulnerable as Belial once was. This act of adoption and training became a vital part of Belial's identity, transforming his drive for vengeance into a mission to protect and empower his new family. Belial’s journey from a grieving son to a formidable warlock, shaped by his origin in The Flame and the catastrophic loss of his family, forged him into a relentless force driven by vengeance and the need to shield those he holds dear.
		- This was exponentially amplified with the kidnapping of his son, with memories missing of the events that occurred, Belial finds himself embarking on a journey to find answers, to seek his son. To deliver vengeance in the name of Azazel.
