- ## Background and History
	- Intro:
		- Willa Waggleriver, a forest gnome of 35 years (equivalent to a youthful 20 in common years), stands a modest three feet tall and weighs 39.5 pounds. Her fair skin is adorned with a constellation of freckles, and her long hair, a blend of greenish brown, flows beneath a traditional wizard’s hat that speaks to her mystical pursuits. Her attire, a long coat in warm hues of orange and brown, reflects her connection to the natural world and her gnomish heritage. Willa is rarely seen without her trusty walking stick, which serves as both a staff and a symbol of her journey in the arcane arts. Her large, brown eyes, filled with curiosity and caution, reveal her inner shyness and the naivety that sometimes leads her astray.
	- Brief History:
		- Willa's upbringing in the Waggleriver family was one steeped in love and knowledge. Her mother, [[Wilma]], a kind yet fiercely protective matriarch, instilled in Willa a sense of strength and independence, while her father, [[Puddle]], a quiet and contemplative gnome, fostered her love for reading and learning. The tranquil forest home where she was raised was also shared with [[Thistlewisp]], a loyal dog she found as a pup while working at the Druid Library. Willa’s bond with [[Thistlewisp]] grew from a chance encounter to a profound companionship, his presence a comforting constant in her life. Her early years were marked by an insatiable quest for knowledge, encouraged by her father’s quiet passion for books, and the nurturing environment her parents provided.
	- Notable Achievements / Conclusion:
		- At the tender age of 15, Willa began her apprenticeship at the Druid Library, under the tutelage of the Master Librarian, a venerable sage known for his vast wisdom and deep connection to nature. Here, Willa’s shy demeanor and cautious approach were tempered by her mentor’s guidance, as she delved into the mysteries of the arcane and the secrets of the natural world. By 16, she had experienced her first communication with forest creatures, a moment that filled her with wonder and solidified her resolve to master druidic magic. Fluent in arcana by 17, Willa dedicated herself to her studies, earning the respect of her peers and the affection of her mentor. However, her journey took a sorrowful turn when her beloved mentor passed away when she was 35, just months before she embarked on her adventure. This loss, coupled with her deep loyalty to his teachings, drives her to carry forward his legacy, despite her innate naivety and cautious outlook on the world. As she steps into a broader, more unpredictable world, Willa's determination to honor her mentor and her thirst for wisdom guide her path, shaping her into a gentle yet steadfast seeker of knowledge and goodness.
