As each of you close your eyes and drift into the realm of dreams, a sense of foreboding washes over you. The air grows thick with an unnatural chill, and an eerie silence pervades the atmosphere. Suddenly, you find yourselves standing amidst the smoldering ruins of Nymeria. The skies are choked with dark, swirling clouds, and the acrid scent of smoke stings your nostrils. The once-vibrant lands you called home are now reduced to ash and rubble.

You each stand in the heart of your beloved homes, now unrecognizable. The elven city of Elyndor lies in ruins, its majestic trees charred and broken. Stonehearth Hold is a crumbling fortress, its proud walls shattered. The bustling markets of Miragefall are deserted, the sands stained with blood. Felshadow is but a ghost town, its secrets buried beneath the debris. Dreadspire Citadel, ominous as ever, stands as the last vestige of a great evil, now unchecked and unchallenged.

Suddenly, the ground trembles violently beneath your feet. The sky splits open, and from the rift, a torrent of dark energy pours forth. The very essence of Nymeria is being consumed by this malevolent force. You watch in helpless horror as your own forms are engulfed. Flames, shadows, or the very earth itself rise up to claim you. Each death is unique, a reflection of your deepest fears and regrets, a testament to the tragedy that has befallen your world.

Just as despair threatens to consume you, a vision pierces through the darkness. In the midst of the chaos, Ravenmoor Outpost emerges, untouched and standing resolute. Its humble buildings glow with an ethereal light, a beacon of hope in the sea of destruction. You feel an inexplicable pull toward this outpost, a sense that it holds the answers you seek. A soft voice, barely a whisper, echoes in your mind: "Go to Ravenmoor. Your destiny awaits."

The dream begins to fade, and as the visions of destruction dissolve, you are left with a profound sense of urgency and determination. Upon waking, you find yourselves marked by the dream, the images of Nymeria's fall and the call to Ravenmoor etched into your memory. Though separated by distance and circumstance, you each know what you must do. Ravenmoor Outpost is your destination, the first step in unraveling the mystery of your shared vision and preventing the impending doom.

Gathering your belongings, you set out on your journey. Each step is filled with purpose, driven by the haunting memories of the dream. The roads to Ravenmoor are fraught with danger, but you are united by a common goal. As you traverse the diverse landscapes of Nymeria, you draw closer to the outpost, and to each other. Your paths converge, and you begin to see the threads of fate weaving your destinies together.

Arriving at Ravenmoor Outpost, you are greeted by a community that, unbeknownst to them, holds the key to your quest. The outpost leader, Tessa Windrider, awaits your arrival. The dream has brought you here, but the journey has just begun. With the vision of Nymeria's destruction fresh in your minds, you stand ready to uncover the truth, forge new alliances, and face the challenges that lie ahead. The fate of Nymeria rests in your hands.
