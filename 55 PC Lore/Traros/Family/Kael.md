- **Backstory:** Kael Windrider was Traros' older brother and closest companion. A skilled warrior, Kael was known for his bravery and leadership on the battlefield. He was a natural leader, admired by his peers and respected by his enemies. Kael took it upon himself to mentor [[Traros]], teaching him the ways of the blade and the importance of honor and justice. His charismatic nature and unwavering loyalty made him a beloved figure in their homeland. Kael's life was cut tragically short when he was falsely accused of treason and executed, a crime orchestrated by those who sought to destroy the Windrider family. His last words to Traros were a plea for justice, igniting Traros' quest to clear his brother's name and avenge his death. Kael's legacy lives on through Traros, who wields Kael's sword, Tempest Edge, as a symbol of their bond and shared destiny.
